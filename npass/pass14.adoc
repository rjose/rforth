** 07:01 >> Get Pass14 set up for ABORT and RESET

** 07:06 (5 min) Let's spec out ABORT and RESET

** 07:19 (18 min) It's not much of a spec, but it's enough

** 07:36 << (35 min) Added a PRINT
Now, we can print our abort messages.

** 07:45 >> Let's add ABORT and RESET next

** 07:52 (7 min) Implemented ABORT
Let's try one out. Yup, it works.

** 08:01 (16 min) Let's add the ABORT word next

** 08:04 (19 min) Done (and works!)
Now, let's add RESET

** 08:10 (25 min) Now, let's see if we can insert RESET so it works

** 08:13 (28 min) I think we have to do this at the assembly level
If we abort, then the whole REPL loop aborts, too. No one can catch in
the forth layer.

** 08:25 << (41 min) Looks good
Let's check this in and then replace our current abort calls with the
new Abort calls.

** 10:19 >> Replace abort messages
Alright, let's replace our abort messages with Abort calls.

** 11:28 << (69 min) Got some messages switched over
It's a little delicate since we can't use the forth stack if we're
manipulating the forth stack.

** 11:30 Let's rename Abort to WAbort
WAbort should be safe to call from forth without worrying about the
stack, etc.

** 11:33 Let's check in

** 12:41 Done replacing errors with aborts
