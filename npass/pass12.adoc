** 21:21 Spec'd out short strings
Not sure what the format of getting a short string should be. We have
to pass a GetString function an index which will return an address. I
suppose the address could come back in rax. If it's 0, then something
went wrong. We could pass the index in rsi.

Whatever we pick, we should make sure we're able to open a file.
