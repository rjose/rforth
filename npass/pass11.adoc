** 16:02 >> Let's start Pass11 by implementing WWhile


** 16:34 (32 min) Implemented WWhile and WRepeat
Let's hook these up and then compile an expression and review. We may
need a NOP word so we can use it in the place of a test where we've
preloaded booleans onto the stack. Though, I suppose we could use .s
for this.

** 16:38 (36 min) Assembled fine
Let's create a definition and review it's compiled result. We'll do
the following:

   : SAMPLE .s WHILE 1 - REPEAT ;

** 16:59 << (57 min) Loop seems to run fine
Let's check in and then take a break.
