= Pass 11: Implement IF, THEN, ELSE


== Tasks
- [x] Create IF word
- [x] Create THEN word
- [x] Test an IF .. THEN construction
- [x] Create ELSE word
- [x] Test an IF .. ELSE .. THEN construction
- [x] Test nested IF .. ELSE .. THEN construction

To implement an IF, we need to add a pseudo entry that does a jump if
false. IF is an immediate word that executes during a compile. It
creates a pseudo entry that gets filled out by a THEN.

We'll need to use the return stack to keep track of where the dangling
IFs need to be wrapped up. We should probably do a check at the end of
a definition to make sure the return stack is unchanged. If so, we
should delete the entry and toss it.

Actually, I believe we can just create an ENTRY param during the
execution of the IF. What makes it a pseudo param is that the IF
created it and that it wasn't looked up in the dictionary.
