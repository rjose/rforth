** 09:58 >> Add Constant function
Let's use Create to create a new dictionary entry. After this is
called, the dp will point to the new entry. Let's spec this out.

** 10:09 (11 min) Spec'ing out Constant function

** 10:23 << (25 min) Done

** 11:53 >> Implement Constant function

** 12:11 (19 min) Implemented Constant
Need to implement DropParam next

** 12:20 (28 min) Implemented DropParam
Let's test DropParam and then try creating a Constant entry.

** 12:35 << (43 min) Looks good.
Let's check this in and then think about how to execute it

** 12:39 Break
After a break, let's add the Constant_rt function and figure out an
execution loop.

** 12:42 How should execute work?
If we were entering input into a forth repl (and if LIMIT were a word
in the dictionary). Hmmm...I guess we could code one pass of the loop
in assembly and then start from there. Once we have "QUIT", we could
run this in a loop. Once we have loops, we can replace the assembly
with the forth loop.

** 14:38 >> Implement Execute
Let's spec this out a little.

** 14:44 Actually, let's implement Interpret which will in turn call Execute

** 14:51 (13 min) Implement Interpret


** 15:07 (29 min) It works!
Interpret was able to find an entry and execute it. Let's try it when
it doesn't find an entry. After that, we can write some code to push
the constant value onto the stack.

** 15:10 << (32 min) Looks good.
Let's check in.

** 15:20 >> Create Constant_rt
Alright, let's implement Constant_rt. Its only function is to push its
param value onto the forth stack.

Uh, so how does it know where its param value is? I suppose we need to
push the value onto the stack.

** 16:03 << (43 min) Works
Looks like the Constant_rt function is working
