= Pass 10: Add conditions

This adds support for IF THEN and IF ELSE THEN constructs


== Tasks
- [x] Spec out IF ELSE THEN constructs
- [x] Define IF and THEN immediate words
- [x] Define ELSE immediate word
- [ ] Ensure conditions nest properly



== Status
- Effort spent: 2h
- Effort left: 3h
- Initial estimate: 5h

** 09:55 >> Let's spec out how IF ELSE THEN should work

** 10:27 << Take a break

** 10:35 >> OK, let's continue this

** 10:49 (14 min) We're gonna need to keep track of the current parameter index
I think this should live in WCompile. We should reset it to 0 when we
create a colon definition. We should increment it everytime we add a
parameter. No one should mess with this variable outside of these two cases.

** 11:22 << (47 min) OK, I have the IF, ELSE, THEN compile steps spec'd out
When we get back, I'll spec out how to execute this.

** 14:55 >> Think through executing a colon definition with a condition
Hmmm...I think we need a special function in here someplace. Let's
revise the examples I have and the spec for IF, ELSE, and THEN.

** 15:04 (9 min) Came up with something that should work (at least un-nested)
Let's re-spec our words.

** 15:17 (22 min) Worked out that we just need Jmp_rt and Jmp_false_rt
It seems like this should be fairly straightforward. However, let's go
through a nested conditional example to make sure it all still works.

** 15:38 << (43 min) The nested version seems to work
When we get back from the play, I'll work on the WIf, WThen, WElse
words and try compiling something simple. We'll stub out Jmp_rt and
Jmp_false_rt. After that, we'll implement both.

** 23:27 Wrote up a spec on loops
I defined WWhile and WRepeat words. It looks like this can be done via
Jmp and Jmp_false, too.
