** 11:05 Should the text input buffer be different than the getc buffer?
It seems like they should be different. I also think getc should be
able to put characters directly into a memory location. We should use
%rdi to hold the location. If we're reading words, we can write into
the text input buffer. If we're reading strings, we can read these
into a string buffer.

** 11:18 We'll need to rewrite getc to store data in a memory location

** 11:19 For the word routine, we should getc into the text input buffer
We'll keep reading characters until we hit the end of the buffer (in
which case we abort) or see a space character. I think I have enough
to spec this out.

** 18:26 >> Let's see if we can write a getc function
We'll use our original getc function as a starting point, but we'll
have it put the read character into a memory location pointed to be
%rdi instead.

** 18:59 (33 min) Implemented a getc
We should check to make sure it works.

** 19:14 << (48 min) Tested it and it seems to have worked!
Let's check in

** 21:57 >> Add read word function

** 22:37 (40 min) Implemented read_word
The basic version is working. I need to handle the EOF and newline
cases, though.

** 22:47 << (50 min) Handle EOF and newlines in read_word
Let's check in. Tomorrow, I'll tidy up the pass2.adoc file and check
that in, too.
