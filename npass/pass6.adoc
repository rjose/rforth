= Pass 6: Add functions to install builtin words

We should have a single call to define all builtin words. The
code for the dictionary entries should each be in their own files. 

== Tasks
- [x] Factor out Create so it can take a string or use ReadWord
- [x] Rename DefineMathWords to DefineBuiltinWords
- [x] Extract push first param value
- [x] Create convention for defining words
- [x] Define "+", "-", "*", "/"


== Status
- Effort spent: 4h
- Effort left: 0h
- Initial estimate: 5h

** 22:41 >> Create an install math functions file

** 22:43 Let's install the "+" function with a nop first
I just want to make sure it works.

** 23:09 Need to rewrite Tick to search for less than 4 chars
Also rewrite Tick to use proper labels.

** 23:15 Fixed ReadWord to null out byte if ran into space/newline/eof

** 23:35 << (56 min) Tomorrow, let's implement the "+" word
Maybe we could also define a macro to make defining words easier

** 19:25 >> Implement "+"
What we want to do is pop two numbers off the stack, add them and then
push the result back onto the stack. After this, I want to define a
macro to define a word.

** 19:41 << (16 min) Looks good
I forgot the numbers were fixed point. I also forgot that the psp
pointer points at one past the top of the stack. Let's check in.

** 19:43 Figure out macros
Not sure if I understand these well enough yet, but using macros would
clean up some of the repetition. I think I'll have to look at this
when I get home.

** 22:14 >> Define a macro to define a word
I'll create a macros.s file and start adding stuff to it.

** 22:51 << (37 min) Defined "-"
Used macros to do this.

Tomorrow, I'll implement "*" and "/". After that, we'll implement ":"
and ";". After that, we should sweep through and rewrite all of the code.

** 20:16 >> Finished taking a consistency pass through Tick.s
After a break, let's build and fix any errors and then go onto Create.s

** 21:31 << (15 min) Done rewriting Tick.s and Create.s

** 07:04 >> Continue sweeping through files and cleaning up

** 07:22 (18 min) Added check for pfa overflow
Also renamed DefineMathWords to DefineBuiltinWords. Extracted
Constant_RT into a PushEntryParam1 function (this will be useful for
VARIABLE as well).

** 07:23 (19 min) Let's create a convention for naming words and implement
We'll start with Constant and then go through the other math
words. From there we can implement multiply and divide.

** 07:40 << (36 min) Rename Constant to WConstant
Let's take a break and then pull out our math operators.

** 08:04 >> Pull out the math operators
OK, let's pull out plus and minus.

** 08:23 << (19 min) Done pulling out math operators
Let's take a break and then implement * and /

** 08:30 >> Let's bust out * and /

** 08:55 (25 min) Implemented WStar
This was a little tricky because I had to realign the decimal points
afterwards. I also needed to handle the rdx:rax holding the
dividend. Let's do WSlash next.

** 09:06 << (36 min) Implemented WSlash
Let's take a break and then implement ".s" to print the stack.

** 09:12 Actually, let's move ".s" and ":", ";" to other passes and then mark Pass6 as done
