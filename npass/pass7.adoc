= Pass 7: Print param stack

The goal of this pass is to implement the ".s" word to print the stack.

== Tasks
- [x] Create an empty ".s" word an hook up
- [x] Port the putc code from our sw_tools repo
- [x] Implement WriteNumber
- [x] Figure out how to print the contents of the stack
- [x] Hook everything up


== Status
- Effort spent: 3h
- Effort left: 0h
- Initial estimate: 3h

** 11:18 >> Let's get Pass7 set up

** 11:22 (4 min) Created new branch and pass docs
Let's start by creating an empty ".s" word and hooking it up.

** 11:26 (8 min) Stubbed out a .s word

** 11:30 (12 min) Port the putc code over
We need to be able to put characters and flush them.

Let's start with our GetC and revise to PutC.

** 12:16 << (58 min) Take a break
Hmmm...I don't think the macros work the way I was thinking. We should
use a macro per line of instruction instead of trying to work
something into the line. This would clean things up better
anyways. For instance, we should have: MSyscall num arg1 arg2 arg3

** 16:37 >> Let's spec out WriteNumber first

** 17:05 << (28 min) Looks good
Let's take a break and then implement this.

** 18:33 >> Implement WriteNumber

** 19:09 << (36 min) Finished coding
OK, I implemented WriteNumber. Let's take a break and then I'll get it working.

** 19:54 >> Debug WriteNumber

** 19:57 (3 min) Got it to assemble
Let's step through it and make sure it works

** 20:15 << (21 min) Got it working
Looks good. Let's check in and then spec out ".s" a bit.

** 21:12 >> Spec out WDotS

** 21:33 (11 min) Done with spec

** 21:33 (11 min) Let's implement WDotS

** 21:45 (23 min) Done implementing
Let's get this to assemble and then take a break.

** 21:45 << (23 min) Wow, it just assembled
We'll take a little break and then try it out. We'll do an empty
stack, then we'll put an element. Then we'll do a math operation.

** 21:52 >> Let's give it a try

** 22:17 (25 min) Got it working
Most of my errors came from not getting the addresses of things
properly. Let's check in and then add a macro for putting a character.

** 22:26 << (34 min) Looks good
Let's finish pass7, check in and sketch out pass8.
