** 06:40 >> Let's start pass1
The first thing is to build an rforth program that just exits.

** 06:56 (16 min) Got a program that just exits
Let's add an exit.s file next and call it.

** 07:01 (21 min) Pass all args on stack
I think I'll take the convention that we always pass arguments on the
stack. The functions should be responsible for consuming the data and
doing something with it.

** 07:02 (22 min) First figure out global and then pass an argument

** 07:09 (29 min) Need the .globl directive
If it's not there, then the label isn't visible outside of that file.

** 07:10 (30 min) Use the stack to pass the exit code

** 07:27 << (47 min) Internal functions can use registers
When calling external functions, we should use the stack. Within an
assembly file, we can use registers. However, if we call an external
function somewhere in between, we need to preserve the registers we
care about.
