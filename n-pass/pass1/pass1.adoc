** 06:24 >> Let's build an assembly language program
I'll start with an example from "Professional Assembly Language" and
then create a Makefile around it. I should also see if I can debug
it. 

** 06:42 (18 min) System calls are in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h


** 06:50 (26 min) Use man pages to see args for system calls
For example, 'man 3 write' describes the arguments. These are placed
in registers starting from EBC and going from there.

** 07:23 << (39 min) Fixed a typo (.section text -> .section .text)

** 07:24 Break
Let's check in and then get some breakfast
